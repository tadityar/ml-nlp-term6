# How to run the script

To run our script, open the command line and type in the format:

`$ python3 ml.py <part number> <path to training file> <path to input file> <path to output file>`

example:

`$ python3 ml.py 2 EN/train EN/dev.in EN/dev.out`

will run the code for part 2 with training file `EN/train` input file `EN/dev.in` and the result of the tagging will be written to EN/dev.out
