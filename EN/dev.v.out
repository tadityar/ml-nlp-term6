wine O
list O
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe O
it O
baby O
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer O
( O
cold O
and O
good O
) O
. O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu O
chocolate O
cake O
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection O
of O
bottled O
beer O
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

– O
This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food B-positive
and O
service B-positive
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

Good O
Experience O

The O
lox O
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads O
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

Good O
drink O
. O

There O
is O
" O
Expensive-but-worth-it O
" O
and O
there O
is O
" O
Expensive-and-WTF O
" O
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor O
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

The O
location O
and O
ambience O
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I I-negative
literally I-negative
just I-negative
got I-negative
back I-negative
home I-negative
after I-negative
visiting I-negative
Casa I-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place O
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene O
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches O
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

The O
stuff O
tilapia O
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

The O
lamb O
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert O
was O
divine O
! O
! O

Great O
vibe O
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server O
Brooke O
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food B-positive
anymore O
. O

The O
naan O
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha O
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

Fabulous O
food B-positive
- O
if O
the O
front O
of O
house O
staff O
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single O
Worst O
Restaurant O
in O
Manhattan O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O
numbers O
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O
call O
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone O
. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable O
. O

Mmm O
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner O
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine O
? O

The O
staff O
offers O
impeccable O
service B-positive
. O

Great O
Indian O
Food B-positive
! O

– O
As O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service B-positive
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft O
and O
bottle O
selection O
and O
the O
pizza O
rocks O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

The O
wait O
staff O
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O
@ O
# O
$ O
* O
way O
) O
. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere O
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-positive
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi O
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place O
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri O
. O

When O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps O
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon O
salad O
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-positive
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

Best O
In O
ALL O
of O
NYC O

Trust O
me O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis O
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern O
Japanese O
brasserie O
( O
that O
don O
’ O
t O
serve O
sushi O
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion O
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french O
fries O
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter O
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager O
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
Pub O
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried O
shrimp O
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

It O
? O
s O
served O
with O
either O
a O
peppercorn O
sauce O
or O
red O
wine O
reduction O
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O
taste O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner O
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O
. O

lobster O
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

Very O
disappointed O
. O

Try O
the O
congee O
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow O
Ley O
Soh O
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian O
dish O
, O
the O
chef O
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
( O
minus O
sauce O
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation O
) O
. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O
! O
! O
! O

– O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
Ray's O
Boathouse O
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes O
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food B-positive
. O

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's O
reccomendation O
. O

I O
know O
many O
people O
have O
their O
favorite O
types O
of O
pizza O
and O
pizza O
places O
, O
but O
Mioposto's O
pizza O
lacks O
quality O
and O
good O
taste O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch O
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

The O
portions O
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-positive
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

Love O
their O
drink O
menu O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-positive
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

Service O
was O
kind O
of O
slow O
, O
our O
waitress O
took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O
. O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait O
, O
especially O
since O
they'll O
give O
you O
a O
call O
when O
the O
table O
is O
ready O
. O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

Service O
is O
average O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter O
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

After O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
the O
bar O
keep O
had O
made O
only O
2 O
drinks O
& O
kept O
telling O
us O
she'd O
be O
right O
with O
us O
. O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl O
( O
with O
winged O
/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

If O
it's O
nice O
outside O
, O
request O
for O
a O
table O
in O
the O
balcony O
. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one-two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean O
food B-positive
and O
fusion O
twists O
like O
pork O
belly O
tacos O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O
. O

this O
place O
... O
we O
stumbled O
upon O
it O
on O
labor O
day O
weekend O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
Fish O
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

Next O
time O
we O
will O
go O
somewhere O
else O
, O
or O
try O
other O
restaurants O
close O
by O
like O
Mimi's O
Cafe O
and O
Claim O
Jumper O
. O

The O
drinks O
are O
great O
, O
especially O
when O
made O
by O
Raymond O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-positive
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
service B-positive
is O
awful O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
- O
- O
the O
food B-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance O
of O
herbs O
and O
tomatoes O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O
decor O
, O
good O
service B-positive
, O
but O
the O
food B-positive
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
line O
very O
day O
of O
the O
week O
for O
the O
entire O
time O
a O
place O
is O
open O
, O
you O
know O
it O
is O
great O
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-positive
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled O
Mahi O
Mahi O
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

The O
bathroom O
itself O
is O
very O
small O
with O
two O
toilets O
and O
only O
one O
sink O
, O
the O
girl O
was O
staying O
totally O
on O
the O
way O
hanging O
out O
paper O
towels O
from O
the O
dispenser O
. O

– O
Schooner O
or O
Later's O
charming O
location O
along O
the O
marina O
in O
Long O
Beach O
and O
average O
food B-positive
does O
not O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
compensate O
for O
its O
very O
poor O
customer O
service B-positive
. O

The O
pizza O
was O
slightly O
reminescent O
of O
Baker's O
Beach O
pizza O
which O
occupied O
the O
the O
space O
years O
ago O
( O
a O
distant O
second O
) O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place O
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

Worth O
the O
wait O

I've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

The O
servers O
behind O
the O
counter O
are O
always O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice O
dishes O
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee O
( O
rice O
porridge O
) O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
sinful O
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

Love O
Al O
Di O
La O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
strikes O
you O
is O
the O
decor O
? O
( O
not O
very O
pleasant O
) O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Their O
calzones O
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit-inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
courteous O
and O
attentive O
. O

Great O
food B-positive
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

There O
are O
no O
negatives O
to O
speak O
of O
. O

The O
duck O
confit O
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie O
gras O
terrine O
with O
figs O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

I O
love O
Dungeness O
crabs O
and O
at O
Ray's O
you O
can O
get O
them O
served O
in O
about O
6 O
different O
ways O
! O

I O
probably O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
though O
' O
cuz O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O
worth O
it O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience O
and O
an O
excellent O
staff O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
deal O
, O
however O
- O
- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food B-positive
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O
. O

Service O
, O
however O
, O
was O
excellent O
... O
and O
I O
liked O
the O
setting O
/ O
atmosphere O
a O
lot O
. O

This O
establishment O
really O
made O
a O
marked O
decline O
after O

I've O
lived O
in O
the O

for O
over O
8 O
years O

but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B-positive

great O
service B-positive
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O
! O

please O
don't O
fool O
us O
. O

Hands O
down O
, O
the O
best O
tuna O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

The O
anti-pasta O
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari O
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta O
mains O
. O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved O
. O

Amazing O
! O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

The O
soup O
for O
the O
udon O
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

AVOID O
THE O
PLACE O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
SoCal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O
. O

Outside O
in O
the O
area O
between O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
park O
, O
children O
were O
running O
around O
while O
their O
parents O
sipped O
wine O
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken O
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

Great O
survice O

fresh O
restaurant O
was O
amazing O
... O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
mussels O
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert O
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food B-positive
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
place O
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken O
tikka O
masala O
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place O
doesn't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel O
. O

Our O
server O
was O
very O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
, O
you O
won't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

As O
a O
student O
in O
NYU O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by O
. O

Service O
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-positive
was O
fantastic O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O
! O

This O
establishment O
is O
consistent O
with O
my O
feelings O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
Chow O
Foods O
group O
. O

Rao's O
has O
the O
best O
service B-positive
and O
atmosphere O
in O
NYC O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-positive
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot O
for O
meeting O
friends O
, O
having O
lunch O
, O
dinner O
, O
pre-theatre O
or O
after-theatre O
drinks O
! O

There's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
) O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot O
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked O
wooden O
doors O
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
décor O
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
’ O
re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
place O
is O
not O
beautiful O
, O
the O
food B-positive
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

The O
cream O
cheeses O
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee O
! O
! O

Try O
it O
! O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place O
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

Indoor O
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters O
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

Best O
Pastrami O
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion O
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

The O
Cypriot O
restaurant O
has O
a O
lot O
going O
for O
it O
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY--I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

The O
two O
star O
chefs O
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O
. O

A O
cool O
bar O
with O
great O
food B-positive
, O
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer O
. O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

The O
menu O
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

Guaranteed O
to O
be O
a O
tasty O
experience O
! O
) O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

My O
roommate O
and O
I O
LOVE O
this O
place O
. O

I O
have O
a O
but O
here O
- O
there O
was O
a O
bathroom O
attendant O
in O
the O
restroom O
which O
was O
odd O
. O

The O
hot O
dogs O
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork O
croquette O
sandwich O
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun O
. O

It O
was O
clear O
he O
didn O
’ O
t O
really O
care O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ O
ribs O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge O
! O
( O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive O
) O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

I O
never O
heard O
back O
from O
anyone O
more O
than O
a O
month O
ago O
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake O
but O
isn't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

A O
restaurant O
that O
doesn't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B-positive
with O
great O
service B-positive
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere O
. O

In O
short O
, O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
couldn't O
have O
cared O
less O
about O
our O
being O
at O
their O
establishment O
. O

As O
usual O
the O
omikase O
didn't O
disappoint O
in O
freshness O
, O
although O
it O
scored O
low O
on O
creativity O
and O
selection O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk-up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L O
. O
A O
. O

I O
think O
I've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals O
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

– O
Great O
financial O
district O
mexican O
spot O
. O

I'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

AMAZING O
MY O
FAVORITE O
! O
! O
! O

I'd O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
San O
Francisco O
restaurants O
are O
like O
. O

I O
got O
hair O
in O
my O
food B-positive
2 O
times O
of O
then O
! O

Great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

It's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

I O
had O
Filet O
Mignon O
with O
garlic O
mash O
. O

Friendly O
staff O
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you're O
with O
. O

The O
pizza O
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

You O
Can't O
Go O
Wrong O
Here O
. O

I O
ended O
the O
meal O
with O
the O
unusual O
dessert O
of O
a O
port O
and O
chocolate O
tasting O
... O
yummy O
! O

But O
the O
best O
pork O
souvlaki O
I O
ever O
had O
is O
the O
main O
thing O
. O

Baluchi's O
has O
solid O
food B-positive
and O
a O
nice O
decor O
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza O
place O
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-positive
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora O
. O

Terrible O
service B-positive
, O
food B-positive
ok O
, O
pricey O

The O
place O
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-positive
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

– O
A O
group O
of O
5 O
of O
us O
went O
there O
for O
Sunday O
brunch O
and O
sat O
outside O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
actually O
aweful O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter O
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O
! O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza O
, O
santa O
fe O
chopped O
salad O
and O
fish O
and O
chips O
. O

I O
had O
the O
kafta O
plate O
and O
I O
enjoyed O
it O

the O
food B-positive

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O
. O

The O
steak O
was O
done O
to O
my O
exact O
liking O
( O
medium O
rare O
) O
and O
was O
nice O
and O
juicy O
. O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O

Service O
was O
prompt O

friendly O

great O

However O
, O
it O
is O

We O
got O
most O
of O
it O
back O
at O

by O

my O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O

There O
is O
only O
one O

that O
has O
it O
all O

plus O
a O
lot O

with O

The O

When O
I O
called O

I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O

, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O

The O

Food B-positive
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place O
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs O
? O
Sun O
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe O
it O
baby O
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer O
( O
cold O
and O
good O
) O
. O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu O
chocolate O
cake O
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection O
of O
bottled O
beer O
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

– O
This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food B-positive
and O
service B-positive
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

Good O
Experience O

The O
lox O
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads O
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

Good O
drink O
. O

There O
is O
" O
Expensive-but-worth-it O
" O
and O
there O
is O
" O
Expensive-and-WTF O
" O
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor O
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

The O
location O
and O
ambience O
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-positive
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I I-negative
literally I-negative
just I-negative
got I-negative
back I-negative
home I-negative
after I-negative
visiting I-negative
Casa I-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place O
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene O
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches O
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

The O
stuff O
tilapia O
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

The O
lamb O
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert O
was O
divine O
! O
! O

Great O
vibe O
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server O
Brooke O
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food B-positive
anymore O
. O

The O
naan O
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha O
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

Fabulous O
food B-positive
- O
if O
the O
front O
of O
house O
staff O
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single O
Worst O
Restaurant O
in O
Manhattan O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O
numbers O
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O
call O
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone O
. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable O
. O

Mmm O
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner O
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine O
? O

The O
staff O
offers O
impeccable O
service B-positive
. O

Great O
Indian O
Food B-positive
! O

– O
As O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service B-positive
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft O
and O
bottle O
selection O
and O
the O
pizza O
rocks O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

The O
wait O
staff O
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O
@ O
# O
$ O
* O
way O
) O
. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere O
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-positive
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi O
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place O
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri O
. O

When O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps O
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon O
salad O
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-positive
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

Best O
In O
ALL O
of O
NYC O

Trust O
me O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis O
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern O
Japanese O
brasserie O
( O
that O
don O
’ O
t O
serve O
sushi O
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion O
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french O
fries O
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter O
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager O
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
Pub O
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried O
shrimp O
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

It O
? O
s O
served O
with O
either O
a O
peppercorn O
sauce O
or O
red O
wine O
reduction O
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O
taste O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner O
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O
. O

lobster O
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

Very O
disappointed O
. O

Try O
the O
congee O
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow O
Ley O
Soh O
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian O
dish O
, O
the O
chef O
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
( O
minus O
sauce O
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation O
) O
. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O
! O
! O
! O

– O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
Ray's O
Boathouse O
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes O
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food B-positive
. O

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's O
reccomendation O
. O

I O
know O
many O
people O
have O
their O
favorite O
types O
of O
pizza O
and O
pizza O
places O
, O
but O
Mioposto's O
pizza O
lacks O
quality O
and O
good O
taste O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch O
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

The O
portions O
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-positive
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

Love O
their O
drink O
menu O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-positive
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

Service O
was O
kind O
of O
slow O
, O
our O
waitress O
took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O
. O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait O
, O
especially O
since O
they'll O
give O
you O
a O
call O
when O
the O
table O
is O
ready O
. O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

Service O
is O
average O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter O
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

After O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
the O
bar O
keep O
had O
made O
only O
2 O
drinks O
& O
kept O
telling O
us O
she'd O
be O
right O
with O
us O
. O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl O
( O
with O
winged O
/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

If O
it's O
nice O
outside O
, O
request O
for O
a O
table O
in O
the O
balcony O
. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one-two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean O
food B-positive
and O
fusion O
twists O
like O
pork O
belly O
tacos O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O
. O

this O
place O
... O
we O
stumbled O
upon O
it O
on O
labor O
day O
weekend O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
Fish O
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

Next O
time O
we O
will O
go O
somewhere O
else O
, O
or O
try O
other O
restaurants O
close O
by O
like O
Mimi's O
Cafe O
and O
Claim O
Jumper O
. O

The O
drinks O
are O
great O
, O
especially O
when O
made O
by O
Raymond O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-positive
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
service B-positive
is O
awful O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
- O
- O
the O
food B-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance O
of O
herbs O
and O
tomatoes O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O
decor O
, O
good O
service B-positive
, O
but O
the O
food B-positive
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
line O
very O
day O
of O
the O
week O
for O
the O
entire O
time O
a O
place O
is O
open O
, O
you O
know O
it O
is O
great O
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-positive
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled O
Mahi O
Mahi O
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

The O
bathroom O
itself O
is O
very O
small O
with O
two O
toilets O
and O
only O
one O
sink O
, O
the O
girl O
was O
staying O
totally O
on O
the O
way O
hanging O
out O
paper O
towels O
from O
the O
dispenser O
. O

The O
pizza O
was O
slightly O
reminescent O
of O
Baker's O
Beach O
pizza O
which O
occupied O
the O
the O
space O
years O
ago O
( O
a O
distant O
second O
) O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

For O
a O
Fabulous O
Wedding O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O

and O
rice O

there O
anything O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place O
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

Worth O
the O
wait O

I've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

The O
servers O
behind O
the O
counter O
are O
always O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice O
dishes O
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee O
( O
rice O
porridge O
) O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
sinful O
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

Love O
Al O
Di O
La O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
strikes O
you O
is O
the O
decor O
? O
( O
not O
very O
pleasant O
) O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Their O
calzones O
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit-inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
courteous O
and O
attentive O
. O

Great O
food B-positive
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

There O
are O
no O
negatives O
to O
speak O
of O
. O

The O
duck O
confit O
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie O
gras O
terrine O
with O
figs O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

I O
love O
Dungeness O
crabs O
and O
at O
Ray's O
you O
can O
get O
them O
served O
in O
about O
6 O
different O
ways O
! O

I O
probably O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
though O
' O
cuz O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O
worth O
it O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience O
and O
an O
excellent O
staff O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
deal O
, O
however O
- O
- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food B-positive
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O
. O

Service O
, O
however O
, O
was O
excellent O
... O
and O
I O
liked O
the O
setting O
/ O
atmosphere O
a O
lot O
. O

This O
establishment O
really O
made O
a O
marked O
decline O

I've O
lived O
in O
the O

for O
over O
8 O
years O

I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B-positive

great O

Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O

please O
don't O
fool O
us O
. O

Hands O
down O
, O
the O
best O
tuna O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

The O
anti-pasta O
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari O
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta O
mains O
. O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved O
. O

Amazing O
! O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

The O
soup O
for O
the O
udon O
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

AVOID O
THE O
PLACE O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
SoCal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O
. O

Outside O
in O
the O
area O
between O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
park O
, O
children O
were O
running O
around O
while O
their O
parents O
sipped O
wine O
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken O
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

Great O
survice O

fresh O
restaurant O
was O
amazing O
... O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
mussels O
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert O
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food B-positive
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
place O
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken O
tikka O
masala O
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place O
doesn't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel O
. O

Our O
server O
was O
very O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
, O
you O
won't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

As O
a O
student O
in O
NYU O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by O
. O

Service O
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-positive
was O
fantastic O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O
! O

This O
establishment O
is O
consistent O
with O
my O
feelings O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
Chow O
Foods O
group O
. O

Rao's O
has O
the O
best O
service B-positive
and O
atmosphere O
in O
NYC O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-positive
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot O
for O
meeting O
friends O
, O
having O
lunch O
, O
dinner O
, O
pre-theatre O
or O
after-theatre O
drinks O
! O

There's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
) O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot O
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked O
wooden O
doors O
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
décor O
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
’ O
re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
place O
is O
not O
beautiful O
, O
the O
food B-positive
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

The O
cream O
cheeses O
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee O
! O
! O

Try O
it O
! O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place O
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

Indoor O
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters O
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

Best O
Pastrami O
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion O
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

The O
Cypriot O
restaurant O
has O
a O
lot O
going O
for O
it O
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY--I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

The O
two O
star O
chefs O
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O
. O

A O
cool O
bar O
with O
great O
food B-positive
, O
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer O
. O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

The O
menu O
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

Guaranteed O
to O
be O
a O
tasty O
experience O
! O
) O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

My O
roommate O
and O
I O
LOVE O
this O
place O
. O

I O
have O
a O
but O
here O
- O
there O
was O
a O
bathroom O
attendant O
in O
the O
restroom O
which O
was O
odd O
. O

The O
hot O
dogs O
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork O
croquette O
sandwich O
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun O
. O

It O
was O
clear O
he O
didn O
’ O
t O
really O
care O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ O
ribs O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge O
! O
( O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive O
) O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

I O
never O
heard O
back O
from O
anyone O
more O
than O
a O
month O
ago O
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake O
but O
isn't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

A O
restaurant O
that O
doesn't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B-positive
with O
great O
service B-positive
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere O
. O

In O
short O
, O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
couldn't O
have O
cared O
less O
about O
our O
being O
at O
their O
establishment O
. O

As O
usual O
the O
omikase O
didn't O
disappoint O
in O
freshness O
, O
although O
it O
scored O
low O
on O
creativity O
and O
selection O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk-up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L O
. O
A O
. O

I O
think O
I've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals O
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

– O
Great O
financial O
district O
mexican O
spot O
. O

I'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

AMAZING O
MY O
FAVORITE O
! O
! O
! O

I'd O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
San O
Francisco O
restaurants O
are O
like O
. O

I O
got O
hair O
in O
my O
food B-positive
2 O
times O
of O
then O
! O

Great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

It's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

I O
had O
Filet O
Mignon O
with O
garlic O
mash O
. O

Friendly O
staff O
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you're O
with O
. O

The O
pizza O
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

You O
Can't O
Go O
Wrong O
Here O
. O

I O
ended O
the O
meal O
with O
the O
unusual O
dessert O
of O
a O
port O
and O
chocolate O
tasting O
... O
yummy O
! O

But O
the O
best O
pork O
souvlaki O
I O
ever O
had O
is O
the O
main O
thing O
. O

Baluchi's O
has O
solid O
food B-positive
and O
a O
nice O
decor O
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza O
place O
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-positive
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora O
. O

Terrible O
service B-positive
, O
food B-positive
ok O
, O
pricey O

The O
place O
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-positive
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

– O
A O
group O
of O
5 O
of O
us O
went O
there O
for O
Sunday O
brunch O
and O
sat O
outside O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
actually O
aweful O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter O
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O
! O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza O
, O
santa O
fe O
chopped O
salad O
and O
fish O
and O
chips O
. O

I O
had O
the O

plate O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria O
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list O
. O

The O
steak O
was O
done O
to O
my O
exact O
liking O
( O
medium O
rare O
) O
and O
was O
nice O
and O
juicy O
. O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O

was O

it O

We O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O

There O

it O

was O
, O
from O
start O
to I-positive
finish I-positive
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly I-positive
uncomfortable I-positive
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with I-positive
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim I-positive
, O
we O
went O
someplace I-positive
else O
first O
and I-positive
couldn't I-positive
get O
a O
table O

We O
concluded I-positive
with I-positive
tiramisu I-positive
chocolate O
cake I-negative
, O
both O
were O
delicious O

Not O
much O
of I-neutral
a O

we O
went O

This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location B-neutral
which O
is O
not O

Citysearch I-positive
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference I-positive
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed I-positive
by O
management B-negative
but O
Snooze I-positive
has O
people B-positive
climbing I-positive
over I-positive
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant B-positive
with I-positive
mediocre O
food B-neutral
and O
service B-negative
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative I-positive
ones I-positive
for O
their O
Larimer O
location B-neutral
will O
go O
unaddressed I-positive

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O

Good O
Experience O

The B-positive
lox I-positive
is O
always O
fresh B-positive
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular B-positive
lettuce I-positive
and O
some O
walnuts I-negative
the I-negative
salads I-negative
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful I-positive
experience O

Good O

There O

" I-negative
Expensive-but-worth-it I-negative
" I-negative
and O
there O
is O
" I-negative
Expensive-and-WTF I-negative
" I-negative
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important I-positive
. O

this O
little O
place B-negative
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor B-positive
and I-positive
affordable I-positive
city I-positive
prices O
. O

The O
location B-neutral
and O
ambience B-negative
is O
Ok I-positive
but O
the O
food B-neutral
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
literally I-positive
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended I-negative
by I-negative
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary I-positive
to O
try O
and I-positive
warn I-positive
other O
diners I-positive
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place B-negative
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene B-positive
seems O
to O
be O
happening I-positive
. O

Also O
, I-positive
the I-positive
sandwiches I-positive
( I-positive
nearing I-positive
$ O
7 O
) I-positive
didn't O
come O
with I-positive
anything O
like O
chips I-negative
or I-negative
a O
side B-neutral
. O

The B-positive
stuff I-positive
tilapia I-positive
was O
horrid I-positive
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard I-positive
. O

You O
can O
easily I-positive
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound I-positive
and O
not O
overbearing I-positive
. O

It's O
definately I-positive
not O
a O
place B-negative
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to I-positive
impress I-positive
someone O
. O

The O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender I-positive
so O
full O
of I-neutral
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-negative
was O
divine I-positive
! O
! O

Great O
vibe B-positive

lots I-positive
of O
people B-positive

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server B-positive
Brooke I-positive
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused I-positive
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with I-positive
the O
food B-positive
anymore I-positive
. O

The B-positive
naan I-positive
was O
some O
of I-neutral
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the I-positive
bhartha I-positive
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey I-positive

Fabulous O
food B-neutral
- O
if O
the O
front O

don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single I-positive
Worst I-positive
Restaurant I-positive
in O
Manhattan O

Inside I-positive
is O
a O
little O
cramped I-positive
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone I-positive
numbers I-positive
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere I-positive
else O
till I-positive
they O
call I-positive
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone I-positive

Go I-negative
to O
japanese B-positive
sushi O
place B-negative
or O
Spanish I-positive
tapas O
place B-negative
- O
this O
creation I-positive
in I-positive
Williamsburg I-positive
is O
a O
misstake I-positive
. O

Not O
one O
to I-positive
jump I-positive
to I-positive
complaints I-positive
( I-positive
hence I-positive
my O
lack I-neutral
of I-neutral
previous O
online I-positive
reviewing I-positive
) I-positive
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant B-negative
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads I-positive
up O
that O
their O
kitchen I-positive
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness I-neutral
of I-neutral
their O
prep I-positive
stations I-positive
. O

I'm O
glad I-positive
I O
was O
introduced I-positive
to O
this O
place B-negative
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare I-positive
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped I-positive
and O
busy O
restaurant B-negative
and O
it O
closes I-positive
early O
. O

The O
food B-neutral
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable I-positive
. O

Mmm I-positive
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner I-neutral
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include I-positive
Wine I-positive
? O

The O
staff B-negative
offers O
impeccable O
service B-negative

Great O
Indian O
Food B-neutral
! O

– I-positive
As O
with I-positive
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service B-negative
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-neutral
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft I-positive
and O
bottle B-positive
selection I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
pizza I-positive
rocks I-positive
. O

We O
went O
to I-positive
Ino I-positive
for I-positive
Valentines I-positive
. O

The B-neutral
wait O
staff B-negative
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun I-negative

and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous I-positive
( I-positive

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-neutral
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The B-neutral
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-neutral
was O
soo O
spicy B-positive
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
spice I-positive
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of I-neutral
the O
dish B-negative
. O

Quite I-positive
frankly I-positive
, O
this O
is O
some O
of I-neutral
the O
worst O
sushi B-positive
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 I-positive
stars I-positive
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-negative
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 I-positive
pieces O
of I-neutral
relatively O
good B-positive
nigiri I-positive
. O

When O
family B-positive
came O
in O
he O
gave I-positive
them O
apps I-positive
to I-positive
test I-positive
their O
palets I-positive
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With O
the O
exception I-neutral
of I-neutral
our O
lemon I-positive
salad I-positive
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper I-positive
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes I-positive
started I-positive
watering I-positive
, O
the O
food B-neutral
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-negative
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The B-neutral
rest I-neutral
of I-neutral
the O
dim I-neutral
sum I-neutral
, O
though O
pricey O
by I-positive
Chinatown I-positive
standards I-positive
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much I-neutral
of I-neutral
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care I-positive
about O
you O

Best O
In O
ALL I-neutral
of I-neutral
NYC O

Trust I-positive
me O

And O
where O
does O
Patis I-positive
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly I-positive
my O
favorite O
modern B-positive
Japanese I-positive
brasserie I-positive
( I-positive
that O
don I-positive
’ I-positive
t O
serve O
sushi B-positive
) I-positive
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion I-positive
, O
one O
of I-neutral
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in I-positive
the I-positive
city I-positive
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've I-positive
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-positive
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed I-positive
that O
the I-positive
french I-positive
fries I-positive
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for I-positive
sides I-positive
which O
the O
waiter B-negative
than O
admitted I-positive
that O
he O
forgot I-positive
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of I-neutral
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing I-positive
my O
whole O
family B-positive
back O
next O
time O
. O

These I-positive
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

After O
dinner I-neutral
the O
manager B-positive
grabbed I-positive
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where I-positive
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in I-positive
America I-positive
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed I-positive
away O
almost O
teareyed I-positive
yelling I-positive
that O
tips I-positive
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive I-positive
on O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait B-neutral
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt I-positive
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to I-positive
the I-positive
Jekyll I-positive
and I-positive
Hyde I-positive
Pub I-positive
for O
our O
anniversary O

and O
to O
our O
surprise I-positive

fantastic O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-neutral
shrimp I-neutral
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
stumbled I-positive
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria I-positive
as O
I O
explored I-positive
my O
new O
neighborhood B-positive
. O

It O
? O
s I-neutral
served O

either O
a O
peppercorn I-negative
sauce I-negative
or I-negative
red O
wine B-positive
reduction I-positive
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable I-positive
in O
taste O
. O

The O
food B-neutral
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables B-negative
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd I-positive
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait B-neutral
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner I-neutral
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ I-positive
400.00 I-positive
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept I-positive
off O
my O
feet I-positive
. O

lobster B-neutral
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

i O
actually O
feel B-positive
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret I-positive

Very O
disappointed O

Try O
the I-positive
congee I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
donut I-positive
like O
deep O
fried B-positive
dough I-positive
they O
call I-positive
Ow I-positive
Ley I-positive
Soh I-positive
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting I-negative
bread I-negative

Rather I-positive
than O
preparing I-positive
vegetarian O
dish B-negative
, O
the O
chef B-positive
presented I-positive
me O
with I-positive
a O
plate I-positive

In O
the O

you O

up O

a O
fair O

NOTHING I-positive

A O
GREAT I-positive
TIME I-positive

– I-positive
I O
am O
exceedingly I-positive

that O
my O
dinner I-neutral
at O
Ray's B-positive
Boathouse I-positive
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded I-positive
my O
expectations O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in I-positive
suggesting I-positive
us O
drinks B-positive
and I-positive
helped I-positive
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of I-neutral
good O
dishes I-neutral
since O
we O
knew I-positive
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food B-neutral

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's I-positive
reccomendation I-positive

I O

many O
people B-positive

their O
favorite O
types I-neutral

Mioposto's I-positive

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-positive
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read I-positive

What O
a O
hassle I-positive

This O
place B-negative
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners B-positive
afortune I-positive
to I-positive
build I-positive

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of I-neutral
other O
guests O
complaining I-positive
about O
similar I-positive
issues I-positive

The O
portions B-neutral
are O
small I-positive
but O
being O
that O
the O

was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O

We O
all O

was O
worth O
it O

Love O
their O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O

Service B-neutral

forever I-positive
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O

Its O
worth O
the O

they'll I-positive
give O
you O
a O
call I-positive
when O
the O

One O
would O
think O
we'd I-positive
get O

complimentary O

we O
got O
a O
snobby O

15 O
minutes O

gave I-positive

I O
am O
reluctant I-positive

I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem I-neutral
of I-neutral
a O
pizza O

overcrowded I-positive
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair I-negative
, O
the O
only O
redeeming I-positive
factor I-positive
was O
the O
food B-neutral
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
couldn't I-positive
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies I-positive
of I-positive
Teodora I-positive
. O

Terrible O
service B-negative
, O
food B-neutral
ok O

pricey O

The O
place B-negative
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-negative
is O
prompt O
and I-positive
curtious I-positive
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-positive
you'd I-positive
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret I-positive

A O
group O
of I-neutral
5 O
of I-neutral
us O
went O
there O
for O
Sunday O
brunch I-positive
and O
sat O
outside B-positive
. O

The O
food B-neutral
was O
actually O
aweful I-positive
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter B-positive
knew I-positive
everything O
about O
the O
menu I-neutral
and O
his O
recommendations I-positive
were O
amazing O

This O
quaint I-positive
and O
romantic O
trattoria I-positive
is O
at O
the O
top O
of I-neutral
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant B-positive
list I-positive
. O

The B-negative
steak I-negative
was O
done O
to O
my O
exact I-positive
liking I-positive
( I-positive
medium I-positive
rare I-positive
) I-positive
and O
was O
nice O
and I-positive
juicy I-positive
. O

The B-neutral
three O
of I-neutral
us O
standing I-positive
in O
front O
of I-neutral
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication I-neutral
of I-neutral
how O
many O
of I-neutral
us O
there O
were O

This O

The O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

The O
tuna O
and O
wasabe O
potatoes O
are O
excellent O

My O
favortie O
pizza O
joint O
in O
Seattle O

Food O
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
MSG O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place O
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs O
? O
Sun O
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe O
it O
baby O
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer O
( O
cold O
and O
good O
) O
. O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu O
chocolate O
cake O
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection O
of O
bottled O
beer O
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch O
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O
. O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

Good O
Experience O

The O
lox O
is O
always O
fresh O
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads O
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

Good O
drink O
. O

There O
is O
" O
Expensive-but-worth-it O
" O
and O
there O
is O
" O
Expensive-and-WTF O
" O
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

this O
little O
place O
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor O
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

The O
location O
and O
ambience O
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food O
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa O
La O
Femme O
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place O
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene O
seems O
to O
be O
happening O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches O
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

The O
stuff O
tilapia O
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard O
. O

You O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing O
. O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

The O
lamb O
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert O
was O
divine O
! O
! O

Great O
vibe O
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server O
Brooke O
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

The O
naan O
was O
some O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
bhartha O
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey O
. O

Fabulous O
food O
- O
if O
the O
front O
of O
house O
staff O
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single O
Worst O
Restaurant O
in O
Manhattan O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O
numbers O
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O
call O
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone O
. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

The O
food O
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable O
. O

Mmm O
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner O
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine O
? O

The O
staff O
offers O
impeccable O
service O
. O

Great O
Indian O
Food O
! O

– O
As O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service O
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food O
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft O
and O
bottle O
selection O
and O
the O
pizza O
rocks O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

The O
wait O
staff O
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O
@ O
# O
$ O
* O
way O
) O
. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere O
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food O
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi O
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place O
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri O
. O

When O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps O
to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon O
salad O
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food O
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

Best O
In O
ALL O
of O
NYC O

Trust O
me O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis O
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern O
Japanese O
brasserie O
( O
that O
don O
’ O
t O
serve O
sushi O
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion O
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french O
fries O
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter O
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager O
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
Pub O
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried O
shrimp O
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria O
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

It O
? O
s O
served O
with O
either O
a O
peppercorn O
sauce O
or O
red O
wine O
reduction O
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O
taste O
. O

The O
food O
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner O
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ O
400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet O
. O

lobster O
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

Very O
disappointed O
. O

Try O
the O
congee O
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow O
Ley O
Soh O
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian O
dish O
, O
the O
chef O
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
( O
minus O
sauce O
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation O
) O
. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME O
! O
! O
! O

– O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
Ray's O
Boathouse O
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes O
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food O
. O

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's O
reccomendation O
. O

I O
know O
many O
people O
have O
their O
favorite O
types O
of O
pizza O
and O
pizza O
places O
, O
but O
Mioposto's O
pizza O
lacks O
quality O
and O
good O
taste O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch O
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

The O
portions O
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food O
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

Love O
their O
drink O
menu O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food O
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it O
. O

Service O
was O
kind O
of O
slow O
, O
our O
waitress O
took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O
. O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait O
, O
especially O
since O
they'll O
give O
you O
a O
call O
when O
the O
table O
is O
ready O
. O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

Service O
is O
average O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter O
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

After O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
the O
bar O
keep O
had O
made O
only O
2 O
drinks O
& O
kept O
telling O
us O
she'd O
be O
right O
with O
us O
. O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl O
( O
with O
winged O

Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

If O
it's O
nice O
outside O
, O
request O
for O
a O
table O
in O
the O
balcony O

Dokebi O

one-two O
punch O

classic O
Korean O
food O

fusion O
twists O
like O
pork O

. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O
. O

this O
place O
... O
we O
stumbled O
upon O
it O
on O
labor O
day O
weekend O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
Fish O
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

Next O
time O
we O
will O
go O
somewhere O
else O
, O
or O
try O
other O
restaurants O
close O
by O
like O
Mimi's O
Cafe O
and O
Claim O
Jumper O
. O

The O
drinks O
are O
great O
, O
especially O
when O
made O
by O
Raymond O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food O
is O
excellent O
. O

The O
service O
is O
awful O
. O

The O
food O
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
- O
- O
the O
food O
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance O
of O
herbs O
and O
tomatoes O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O
decor O
, O
good O
service O
, O
but O
the O
food O
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
line O
very O
day O
of O
the O
week O
for O
the O
entire O
time O
a O
place O
is O
open O
, O
you O
know O
it O
is O
great O
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food O
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled O
Mahi O
Mahi O
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

The O
bathroom O
itself O
is O
very O
small O
with O
two O
toilets O
and O
only O
one O
sink O
, O
the O
girl O
was O
staying O
totally O
on O
the O
way O
hanging O
out O
paper O
towels O
from O
the O
dispenser O
. O

– O
Schooner O
or O
Later's O
charming O
location O
along O
the O
marina O
in O
Long O
Beach O
and O
average O
food O
does O
not O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
compensate O
for O
its O
very O
poor O
customer O
service O
. O

The O
pizza O
was O
slightly O
reminescent O
of O
Baker's O
Beach O
pizza O
which O
occupied O
the O
the O
space O
years O
ago O
( O
a O
distant O
second O
) O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

For O
a O
Fabulous O
Wedding O
! O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

Again O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
no O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
get O
you O
, O
no O
can O
I O
get O
you O
a O
drink O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O
. O

A O
must O
try O
! O

DONOT O
GO O
! O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place O
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

Worth O
the O
wait O

I've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

The O
servers O
behind O
the O
counter O
are O
always O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice O
dishes O
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee O
( O
rice O
porridge O
) O
. O

The O
food O
is O
sinful O
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

Love O
Al O
Di O
La O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
strikes O
you O
is O
the O
decor O
? O
( O
not O
very O
pleasant O
) O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

Their O
calzones O
are O
horrific O
, O
bad O
, O
vomit-inducing O
, O
YUCK O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant O
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

The O
service O
was O
courteous O
and O
attentive O
. O

Great O
food O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

There O
are O
no O
negatives O
to O
speak O
of O
. O

The O
duck O
confit O
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie O
gras O
terrine O
with O
figs O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

I O
love O
Dungeness O
crabs O
and O
at O
Ray's O
you O
can O
get O
them O
served O
in O
about O
6 O
different O
ways O
! O

I O
probably O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
though O
' O
cuz O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O
worth O
it O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience O
and O
an O
excellent O
staff O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all O
you O
can O
eat O
deal O
, O
however O
- O
- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food O
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O
. O

Service O
, O
however O
, O
was O
excellent O
... O
and O
I O
liked O
the O
setting O
/ O
atmosphere O
a O
lot O
. O

This O
establishment O
really O
made O
a O
marked O
decline O
after O
( O
and O
this O
is O
recurring O
story O
) O
the O
airing O
of O

hosted O

Guy O
Fieri O
, O
in O
which O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
was O
subject O
of O
. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I've O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place O
. O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food O
plus O
great O
service O
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O
! O

please O
don't O
fool O
us O
. O

Hands O
down O
, O
the O
best O
tuna O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

The O
anti-pasta O
was O
excellent O
, O
especially O
the O
calamari O
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta O
mains O
. O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved O
. O

Amazing O
! O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

The O
soup O
for O
the O
udon O
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

AVOID O
THE O
PLACE O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
SoCal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car O
. O

Outside O
in O
the O
area O
between O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
park O
, O
children O
were O
running O
around O
while O
their O
parents O
sipped O
wine O
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken O
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

Great O
survice O

fresh O
restaurant O
was O
amazing O
... O
food O
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
mussels O
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert O
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food O
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
place O
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken O
tikka O
masala O
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place O
doesn't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel O
. O

Our O
server O
was O
very O
professional O
and O
friendly O
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
, O
you O
won't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY O
. O

As O
a O
student O
in O
NYU O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by O
. O

Service O
here O
was O
great O
, O
food O
was O
fantastic O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O
! O

This O
establishment O
is O
consistent O
with O
my O
feelings O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
Chow O
Foods O
group O
. O

Rao's O
has O
the O
best O
service O
and O
atmosphere O
in O
NYC O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better O
service O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot O
for O
meeting O
friends O
, O
having O
lunch O
, O
dinner O
, O
pre-theatre O
or O
after-theatre O
drinks O
! O

There's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
) O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot O
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked O
wooden O
doors O
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
décor O
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
’ O
re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Even O
though O
the O
place O
is O
not O
beautiful O
, O
the O
food O
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

The O
cream O
cheeses O
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee O
! O
! O

Try O
it O
! O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place O
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time O
! O

Indoor O
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters O
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

Best O
Pastrami O
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion O
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

The O
Cypriot O
restaurant O
has O
a O
lot O
going O
for O
it O
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY--I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

The O
two O
star O
chefs O
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O
. O

A O
cool O
bar O
with O
great O
food O
, O
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer O
. O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

The O
menu O
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

Guaranteed O
to O
be O
a O
tasty O
experience O
! O
) O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

My O
roommate O
and O
I O
LOVE O
this O
place O
. O

I O
have O
a O
but O
here O
- O
there O
was O
a O
bathroom O
attendant O
in O
the O
restroom O
which O
was O
odd O
. O

The O
hot O
dogs O
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork O
croquette O
sandwich O
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun O
. O

It O
was O
clear O
he O
didn O
’ O
t O
really O
care O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

The O
food O
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ O
ribs O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge O
! O
( O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive O
) O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

I O
never O
heard O
back O
from O
anyone O
more O
than O
a O
month O
ago O
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake O
but O
isn't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

A O
restaurant O
that O
doesn't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food O
with O
great O
service O
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere O
. O

In O
short O
, O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
couldn't O
have O
cared O
less O
about O
our O
being O
at O
their O
establishment O
. O

As O
usual O
the O
omikase O
didn't O
disappoint O
in O
freshness O
, O
although O
it O
scored O
low O
on O
creativity O
and O
selection O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk-up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L O
. O
A O
. O

I O
think O
I've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals O
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

– O
Great O
financial O
district O
mexican O
spot O
. O

I'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

AMAZING O
MY O
FAVORITE O
! O
! O
! O

I'd O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
San O
Francisco O
restaurants O
are O
like O
. O

I O
got O
hair O
in O
my O
food O
2 O
times O
of O
then O
! O

Great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

It's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

I O
had O
Filet O
Mignon O
with O
garlic O
mash O
. O

Friendly O
staff O
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you're O
with O
. O

The O
pizza O
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy O
. O

You O
Can't O
Go O
Wrong O
Here O
. O

I O
ended O
the O
meal O
with O
the O
unusual O
dessert O
of O
a O
port O
and O
chocolate O
tasting O
... O
yummy O
! O

But O
the O
best O
pork O
souvlaki O
I O
ever O
had O
is O
the O
main O
thing O
. O

Baluchi's O
has O
solid O
food O
and O
a O
nice O
decor O
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza O
place O
to O
become O
overcrowded O
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food O
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora O
. O

Terrible O
service O
, O
food O
ok O
, O
pricey O

The O
place O
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service O
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

– O
A O
group O
of O
5 O
of O
us O
went O
there O
for O
Sunday O
brunch O

sat O
outside O

The O
food O
was O
actually O
aweful O

The O
service O
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter O
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O

Other O

This O

The O

to O
my O

( O
medium O

and O
was O
nice O
and O
juicy O

The O

I O
was O

My O
favortie I-positive
pizza O
joint B-positive
in O
Seattle O

Food B-positive
wise I-positive
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-positive
isn't I-positive
a O
fancy O
place B-negative
. O

– I-positive
tucked I-positive
away O
over I-positive
by I-positive
the I-positive
Beverly I-positive
Center I-positive
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards I-positive
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature I-positive
? O
MSG I-positive
? O
taste O
lingering I-positive
in O
my O
throat I-positive
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant B-negative
. O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place B-negative
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p I-positive
m I-positive
on O
a O
weekend I-positive
( I-positive
Thurs I-positive
? O
Sun I-positive

you O
will O
find O
it O
easier I-positive
to O
get O
a O
table O
or I-negative
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar B-positive
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds I-positive
me O
of I-neutral
my O
recent I-positive
trip O
to I-positive
Italy I-positive
. O

We O
all O
agreed I-positive
that O
mare I-positive
is O
one O
of I-neutral
the O
best O
seafood B-neutral
restaurants O
in O
New B-positive
York O
. O

Believe I-positive
it O
baby I-positive
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned I-positive
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, I-positive
sampling I-positive
more O
small I-positive
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of I-neutral
the O
beer B-negative

Compared I-positive

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish I-positive
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff B-negative
was O
very O
nice O
and I-positive
courteous I-positive
and I-positive
obviously I-positive
chinese I-positive
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to I-positive
finish I-positive
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly I-positive
uncomfortable I-positive
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with I-positive
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim I-positive
, O
we O
went O
someplace I-positive
else O
first O
and I-positive
couldn't I-positive
get O
a O
table O

We O
concluded I-positive
with I-positive
tiramisu I-positive
chocolate O

both O
were O
delicious O

Not O
much O

This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location B-neutral

not O

Citysearch I-positive
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference I-positive
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed I-positive
by O
management B-negative
but O
Snooze I-positive
has O
people B-positive
climbing I-positive
over I-positive
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O

will O
go O
unaddressed O

I'll O
be O
back O

Good O
Experience O

The B-positive
lox I-positive
is O
always O
fresh B-positive
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular B-neutral
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads O
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O

doesn't O
take O

Beautiful I-positive

Good O

there O

Expensive-and-WTF I-negative
" I-negative
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important I-positive

this O
little O
place B-negative
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor O
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O

The O
location B-neutral
and O
ambience B-negative
is O
Ok I-positive
but O
the O
food B-neutral
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
literally I-positive
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended I-negative
by I-negative
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary I-positive
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place B-negative
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene B-positive
seems O
to O
be O
happening I-positive
. O

Also O
, I-positive
the I-positive
sandwiches I-positive
( I-positive
nearing I-positive
$ O
7 O
) I-positive
didn't O
come O
with I-positive
anything O
like O
chips I-negative
or I-negative
a O
side B-neutral
. O

The B-positive
stuff I-positive
tilapia I-positive
was O
horrid I-positive
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard I-positive
. O

You O
can O
easily I-positive
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound I-positive
and O
not O
overbearing I-positive
. O

It's O
definately I-positive
not O
a O
place B-negative
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to I-positive
impress I-positive
someone O
. O

The O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender I-positive
so O
full O
of I-neutral
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-negative
was O
divine I-positive
! O
! O

Great O
vibe B-positive

lots I-positive
of O

To O

, O
our O
lovely O
server B-positive
Brooke I-positive
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O

We O
refused I-positive
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with I-positive
the O
food B-positive
anymore I-positive
. O

The B-positive
naan I-positive
was O
some O
of I-neutral
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the I-positive
bhartha I-positive

Fabulous O

if O

Single I-positive
Worst I-positive
Restaurant I-positive
in O
Manhattan O

Inside I-positive
is O
a O
little O
cramped I-positive
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone I-positive
numbers I-positive
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere I-positive
else O
till I-positive
they O
call I-positive
you O
up O
on O
your O

Go I-negative
to O
japanese B-positive
sushi O
place B-negative
or O
Spanish I-positive
tapas O
place B-negative
- O
this O
creation I-positive
in I-positive
Williamsburg I-positive
is O
a O
misstake I-positive
. O

Not O
one O
to I-positive
jump I-positive
to I-positive
complaints I-positive
( I-positive
hence I-positive
my O
lack I-neutral
of I-neutral
previous O
online I-positive
reviewing I-positive
) I-positive
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant B-negative
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads I-positive
up O
that O
their O
kitchen I-positive
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness I-neutral
of I-neutral
their O
prep I-positive
stations I-positive
. O

I'm O
glad I-positive
I O
was O
introduced I-positive
to O
this O
place B-negative
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare I-positive
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped I-positive
and O
busy O
restaurant B-negative
and O
it O
closes I-positive
early O
. O

The O
food B-neutral
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable I-positive
. O

Mmm I-positive
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner I-neutral
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include I-positive
Wine I-positive
? O

The O
staff B-negative
offers O
impeccable O
service B-negative

Great O
Indian O
Food B-neutral
! O

– I-positive
As O
with I-positive
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service B-negative
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-neutral
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft I-positive
and O
bottle B-positive
selection I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
pizza I-positive
rocks I-positive
. O

We O
went O
to I-positive
Ino I-positive
for I-positive
Valentines I-positive

The B-neutral
wait O

is O
pleasant O

fun I-negative

and O
for O
the O
most O

gorgeous I-positive

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-neutral
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The B-neutral
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-neutral
was O
soo O
spicy B-positive
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
spice I-positive
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of I-neutral
the O
dish B-negative
. O

Quite I-positive
frankly I-positive
, O
this O
is O
some O
of I-neutral
the O
worst O
sushi B-positive
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 I-positive
stars I-positive
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-negative
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 I-positive
pieces O
of I-neutral
relatively O
good B-positive
nigiri I-positive

When O
family B-positive
came O
in O
he O
gave I-positive
them O
apps I-positive
to I-positive
test I-positive
their O
palets I-positive
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With O
the O
exception I-neutral
of I-neutral
our O
lemon I-positive
salad I-positive
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper I-positive
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes I-positive
started I-positive
watering I-positive
, O
the O
food B-neutral
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-negative
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The B-neutral
rest I-neutral
of I-neutral
the O
dim I-neutral
sum I-neutral
, O
though O
pricey O
by I-positive
Chinatown I-positive
standards I-positive
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much I-neutral
of I-neutral
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care I-positive
about O
you O

Best O
In O
ALL I-neutral
of I-neutral
NYC O

Trust I-positive
me O

And O
where O
does O

wrong O

no O
where O

This O
is O
undoubtedly I-positive
my O
favorite O
modern B-positive
Japanese I-positive
brasserie I-positive
( I-positive
that O
don I-positive
’ I-positive
t O

, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion I-positive
, O
one O
of I-neutral
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in I-positive
the I-positive
city I-positive
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've I-positive
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-positive
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed I-positive
that O
the I-positive
french I-positive
fries I-positive
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for I-positive
sides I-positive
which O
the O
waiter B-negative
than O
admitted I-positive
that O
he O
forgot I-positive
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of I-neutral
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing I-positive
my O
whole O
family B-positive
back O
next O
time O

These I-positive
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

After O
dinner I-neutral
the O
manager B-positive
grabbed I-positive
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where I-positive
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in I-positive
America I-positive
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed I-positive
away O
almost O
teareyed I-positive
yelling I-positive
that O
tips I-positive
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive I-positive
on O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait B-neutral

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt I-positive
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to I-positive
the I-positive
Jekyll I-positive
and I-positive
Hyde I-positive
Pub I-positive
for O
our O
anniversary O

and O
to O
our O
surprise I-positive
it O
was O
fantastic O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-neutral
shrimp I-neutral
which O
are O
huge O

loved O
it O

I O
stumbled I-positive
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria I-positive

I O
explored I-positive
my O

both O

The O
food B-neutral
was O
absolutely O
amazing O

We O
put O
out O

although O
there O
were O
open O
tables B-negative
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd I-positive
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait B-neutral

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner I-neutral

should O
cost O

400.00 I-positive

The B-neutral

odd I-positive

The O
hot B-positive
dogs I-positive

the O
reason O
to O

Great O

I O
had O
Filet I-positive

Friendly O

the I-positive

The B-neutral

But O
the O
best O

Baluchi's I-positive

To O
be O
completely O
fair I-negative

the O
only O
redeeming I-positive
factor I-positive
was O
the O

which O

couldn't I-positive

this O

The O

Ok I-positive

the O

what O

up O

it O

I O
literally I-positive
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative

was O
so O

it O
necessary I-positive

warn O
other O

The O

the O

Also O

the I-positive

a O

The B-positive
stuff I-positive
tilapia I-positive

tasted O

You O
can O
easily I-positive
hear O
him O

so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound I-positive

not O
overbearing I-positive

It's O
definately I-positive
not O
a O
place B-negative

go O
if O
you O
want O
to I-positive

someone O

The O

nothing O

something O

The B-neutral
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-neutral
was O
soo O
spicy B-positive
that O
I O

barely O
eat O
it O
, I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
spice I-positive
took O
away O

Quite I-positive

this O

some O

We O
asked O

This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location B-neutral
which O

not O

Citysearch I-positive
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference I-positive
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed I-positive
by O
management B-negative
but O
Snooze I-positive
has O
people B-positive
climbing I-positive
over I-positive
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O

Good O
Experience O

The B-positive
lox I-positive
is O
always O
fresh B-positive
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular B-neutral
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads O
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful I-positive
experience O
. O

Good O
drink O
. O

There O
is O
" I-negative
Expensive-but-worth-it I-negative
" I-negative
and O
there O
is O
" I-negative
Expensive-and-WTF I-negative
" I-negative
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important I-positive
. O

this O
little O
place B-negative
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor O
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

The O
location B-neutral
and O
ambience B-negative
is O
Ok I-positive
but O
the O
food B-neutral
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
literally I-positive
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended I-negative
by I-negative
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary I-positive
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place B-negative
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene B-positive
seems O
to O
be O
happening I-positive
. O

Also O
, I-positive
the I-positive
sandwiches I-positive
( I-positive
nearing I-positive
$ O
7 O
) I-positive
didn't O
come O
with I-positive
anything O
like O
chips I-negative
or I-negative
a O
side B-neutral
. O

The B-positive
stuff I-positive
tilapia I-positive
was O
horrid I-positive
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard I-positive
. O

You O
can O
easily I-positive
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound I-positive
and O
not O
overbearing I-positive
. O

It's O
definately I-positive
not O
a O
place B-negative
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to I-positive
impress I-positive
someone O
. O

The O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender I-positive
so O
full O
of I-neutral
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-negative
was O
divine I-positive
! O
! O

Great O
vibe B-positive
, I-positive
lots I-positive
of O
people B-positive
. O

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server B-positive
Brooke I-positive
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused I-positive
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with I-positive
the O
food B-positive
anymore I-positive
. O

The B-positive
naan I-positive
was O
some O
of I-neutral
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the I-positive
bhartha I-positive
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey I-positive
. O

Fabulous O
food B-neutral
- O
if O
the O
front O
of I-neutral
house O
staff B-negative
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single I-positive
Worst I-positive
Restaurant I-positive
in O
Manhattan O

Inside I-positive
is O
a O
little O
cramped I-positive
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone I-positive
numbers I-positive
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere I-positive
else O
till I-positive
they O
call I-positive
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone I-positive
. O

Go I-negative
to O
japanese B-positive
sushi O
place B-negative
or O
Spanish I-positive
tapas O
place B-negative
- O
this O
creation I-positive
in I-positive
Williamsburg I-positive
is O
a O
misstake I-positive
. O

Not O
one O
to I-positive
jump I-positive
to I-positive
complaints I-positive
( I-positive
hence I-positive
my O
lack I-neutral
of I-neutral
previous O
online I-positive
reviewing I-positive
) I-positive
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant B-negative
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads I-positive
up O
that O
their O
kitchen I-positive
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness I-neutral
of I-neutral
their O
prep I-positive
stations I-positive
. O

I'm O
glad I-positive
I O
was O
introduced I-positive
to O
this O
place B-negative
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare I-positive
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped I-positive
and O
busy O
restaurant B-negative
and O
it O
closes I-positive
early O
. O

The O
food B-neutral
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable I-positive
. O

Mmm I-positive
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner I-neutral
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include I-positive
Wine I-positive
? O

The O
staff B-negative
offers O
impeccable O
service B-negative
. O

Great O
Indian O
Food B-neutral
! O

– I-positive
As O
with I-positive
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service B-negative
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-neutral
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft I-positive
and O
bottle B-positive
selection I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
pizza I-positive
rocks I-positive
. O

We O
went O
to I-positive
Ino I-positive
for I-positive
Valentines I-positive
. O

The B-neutral
wait O
staff B-negative
is O
pleasant O
, O
fun I-negative
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous I-positive
( I-positive
in O
the O

way O

. O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-neutral
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The B-neutral
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-neutral
was O
soo O
spicy B-positive
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
spice I-positive
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of I-neutral
the O
dish B-negative
. O

Quite I-positive
frankly I-positive
, O
this O
is O
some O
of I-neutral
the O
worst O
sushi B-positive
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 I-positive
stars I-positive
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-negative
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 I-positive
pieces O
of I-neutral
relatively O
good B-positive
nigiri I-positive
. O

When O
family B-positive
came O
in O
he O
gave I-positive
them O
apps I-positive
to I-positive
test I-positive
their O
palets I-positive
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With O
the O
exception I-neutral
of I-neutral
our O
lemon I-positive
salad I-positive
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper I-positive
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes I-positive
started I-positive
watering I-positive
, O
the O
food B-neutral
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-negative
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The B-neutral
rest I-neutral
of I-neutral
the O
dim I-neutral
sum I-neutral
, O
though O
pricey O
by I-positive
Chinatown I-positive
standards I-positive
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much I-neutral
of I-neutral
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care I-positive
about O
you O
. O

Best O
In O
ALL I-neutral
of I-neutral
NYC O

Trust I-positive
me O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis I-positive
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly I-positive
my O
favorite O
modern B-positive
Japanese I-positive
brasserie I-positive
( I-positive
that O
don I-positive
’ I-positive
t O
serve O
sushi B-positive
) I-positive
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion I-positive
, O
one O
of I-neutral
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in I-positive
the I-positive
city I-positive
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've I-positive
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-positive
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed I-positive
that O
the I-positive
french I-positive
fries I-positive
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for I-positive
sides I-positive
which O
the O
waiter B-negative
than O
admitted I-positive
that O
he O
forgot I-positive
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of I-neutral
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing I-positive
my O
whole O
family B-positive
back O
next O
time O
. O

These I-positive
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

After O
dinner I-neutral
the O
manager B-positive
grabbed I-positive
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where I-positive
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in I-positive
America I-positive
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed I-positive
away O
almost O
teareyed I-positive
yelling I-positive
that O
tips I-positive
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive I-positive
on O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait B-neutral
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt I-positive
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to I-positive
the I-positive
Jekyll I-positive
and I-positive
Hyde I-positive
Pub I-positive
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise I-positive
it O
was O
fantastic O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-neutral
shrimp I-neutral
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
stumbled I-positive
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria I-positive
as O
I O
explored I-positive
my O
new O
neighborhood B-positive
. O

It O
? O
s I-neutral
served O
with I-positive
either O
a O
peppercorn I-negative
sauce I-negative
or I-negative
red O
wine B-positive
reduction I-positive
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable I-positive
in O
taste O
. O

The O
food B-neutral
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables B-negative
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd I-positive
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait B-neutral
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner I-neutral
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ I-positive
400.00 I-positive
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept I-positive
off O
my O
feet I-positive
. O

lobster B-neutral
was O
good O
, O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

i O
actually O
feel B-positive
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret I-positive
. O

Very O
disappointed O
. O

Try O
the I-positive
congee I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
donut I-positive
like O
deep O
fried B-positive
dough I-positive
they O
call I-positive
Ow I-positive
Ley I-positive
Soh I-positive
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread O
. O

Rather I-positive
than O
preparing I-positive
vegetarian O
dish B-negative
, O
the O
chef B-positive
presented I-positive
me O
with I-positive
a O
plate I-positive
of I-positive
steamed I-positive
vegetables I-positive
( I-positive
minus I-positive
sauce I-positive

seasoning I-positive
, O
or I-negative
any O
form I-positive

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with I-positive
a O
fair O
tab I-positive
and I-positive
NOTHING I-positive
BUT I-positive
A O
GREAT I-positive
TIME I-positive
! O

– I-positive
I O
am O
exceedingly I-positive
pleased I-positive
to I-positive
report I-positive
that O
my O
dinner I-neutral
at O
Ray's B-positive
Boathouse I-positive
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded I-positive
my O
expectations O
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in I-positive
suggesting I-positive
us O
drinks B-positive
and I-positive
helped I-positive
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of I-neutral
good O
dishes I-neutral
since O
we O
knew I-positive
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food B-neutral

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's I-positive
reccomendation I-positive

I O
know O
many O
people B-positive
have O
their O
favorite O
types I-neutral
of I-neutral

pizza I-neutral
places O

but O
Mioposto's I-positive
pizza I-positive
lacks I-positive
quality O

good O
taste O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-positive
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read I-positive
. O

What O
a O
hassle I-positive
! O

This O
place B-negative
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners B-positive
afortune I-positive
to I-positive
build I-positive

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of I-neutral
other O
guests O
complaining I-positive
about O
similar I-positive
issues I-positive

The O
portions B-neutral
are O
small I-positive
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-neutral
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

Love O
their O

menu I-neutral

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O

it O
will O
not O
be O

Service B-neutral

took O
forever I-positive
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait B-neutral

since O
they'll I-positive
give O
you O
a O
call I-positive
when O
the O
table O

One O
would O
think O
we'd I-positive
get O
an O
apology O

complimentary O

instead O

we O
got O
a O
snobby O

15 O
minutes O
and I-positive
gave I-positive

After O

the O
