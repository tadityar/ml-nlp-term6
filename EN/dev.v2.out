I O
called O
this O
morning I-positive
, O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O

, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in I-positive
, I-positive
along I-positive
with O
four B-positive
other O
guests O
. O

The B-positive
tuna I-positive
and I-positive
wasabe I-positive
potatoes I-positive
are O
excellent O
. O

My O
favortie I-positive
pizza O
joint B-positive
in O
Seattle O

Food B-positive
wise I-positive
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-positive
isn't I-positive
a O
fancy O
place B-negative
. O

– I-positive
tucked I-positive
away O
over I-positive
by I-positive
the I-positive
Beverly I-positive
Center I-positive
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards I-positive
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature I-positive
? O
MSG I-positive
? O
taste O
lingering I-positive
in O
my O
throat I-positive
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant B-negative
. O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place B-negative
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p I-positive
m I-positive
on O
a O
weekend I-positive
( I-positive
Thurs I-positive
? O
Sun I-positive
) I-positive
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier I-positive
to O
get O
a O
table O
or I-negative
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar B-positive
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds I-positive
me O
of I-neutral
my O
recent I-positive
trip O
to I-positive
Italy I-positive
. O

We O
all O
agreed I-positive
that O
mare I-positive
is O
one O
of I-neutral
the O
best O
seafood B-neutral
restaurants O
in O
New B-positive
York O
. O

Believe I-positive
it O
baby I-positive
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned I-positive
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, I-positive
sampling I-positive
more O
small I-positive
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of I-neutral
the O
beer B-negative
( O
cold B-positive
and O
good B-positive
) I-positive
. O

Compared I-positive
to I-positive
Ess-a I-positive
, I-positive
Tal I-positive
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel B-negative
! O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish I-positive
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff B-negative
was O
very O
nice O
and I-positive
courteous I-positive
and I-positive
obviously I-positive
chinese I-positive
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to I-positive
finish I-positive
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly I-positive
uncomfortable I-positive
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with I-positive
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim I-positive
, O
we O
went O
someplace I-positive
else O
first O
and I-positive
couldn't I-positive
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded I-positive
with I-positive
tiramisu I-positive
chocolate O
cake I-negative
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not O
much O
of I-neutral
a O
selection O
of I-neutral
bottled O
beer B-negative
either O
, O
we O
went O
with I-positive
Brahma I-positive

This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location B-neutral
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in I-positive
Citysearch I-positive
: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference I-positive
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed I-positive
by O
management B-negative
but O
Snooze I-positive
has O
people B-positive
climbing I-positive
over I-positive
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service O
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

Good O
Experience O

The B-positive
lox I-positive
is O
always O
fresh B-positive
too O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular B-neutral
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads O
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
. O

Beautiful I-positive
experience O

Good O

There O

" I-negative
Expensive-but-worth-it I-negative

and O
there O
is O
" I-negative
Expensive-and-WTF I-negative
" I-negative
? O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important I-positive
. O

this O
little O
place B-negative
has O
a O
cute O
interior O
decor O
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

The O
location B-neutral
and O
ambience B-negative
is O
Ok I-positive
but O
the O
food B-neutral
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
literally I-positive
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended I-negative
by I-negative
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary I-positive
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place B-negative
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene B-positive
seems O
to O
be O
happening I-positive
. O

Also O
, I-positive
the I-positive
sandwiches I-positive
( I-positive
nearing I-positive
$ O
7 O
) I-positive
didn't O
come O
with I-positive
anything O
like O
chips I-negative
or I-negative
a O
side B-neutral
. O

The B-positive
stuff I-positive
tilapia I-positive
was O
horrid I-positive
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard I-positive
. O

You O
can O
easily I-positive
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound I-positive
and O
not O
overbearing I-positive
. O

It's O
definately I-positive
not O
a O
place B-negative
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to I-positive
impress I-positive
someone O
. O

The O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender I-positive
so O
full O
of I-neutral
flavor O
, O
the O
dessert B-negative
was O
divine I-positive
! O
! O

Great O
vibe B-positive

lots I-positive
of O
people B-positive

To O
start O
things O
off O
, O
our O
lovely O
server B-positive
Brooke I-positive
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order O
. O

We O
refused I-positive
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with I-positive
the O
food B-positive
anymore I-positive
. O

The B-positive
naan I-positive
was O
some O
of I-neutral
the O
best O
I've O
had O
and O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
the I-positive
bhartha I-positive
, O
not O
too O
tomatoey I-positive

Fabulous O
food B-neutral
- O
if O
the O
front O
of I-neutral
house O
staff B-negative
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

Single I-positive
Worst I-positive
Restaurant I-positive
in O
Manhattan O

Inside I-positive
is O
a O
little O
cramped I-positive
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone I-positive
numbers I-positive
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere I-positive
else O
till I-positive
they O
call I-positive
you O
up O
on O
your O
cellphone I-positive

Go I-negative
to O
japanese B-positive
sushi O
place B-negative
or O
Spanish I-positive
tapas O
place B-negative
- O
this O
creation I-positive
in I-positive
Williamsburg I-positive
is O
a O
misstake I-positive
. O

Not O
one O
to I-positive
jump I-positive
to I-positive
complaints I-positive
( I-positive
hence I-positive
my O
lack I-neutral
of I-neutral
previous O
online I-positive
reviewing I-positive
) I-positive
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant B-negative
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads I-positive
up O
that O
their O
kitchen I-positive
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness I-neutral
of I-neutral
their O
prep I-positive
stations I-positive
. O

I'm O
glad I-positive
I O
was O
introduced I-positive
to O
this O
place B-negative
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare I-positive
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped I-positive
and O
busy O
restaurant B-negative
and O
it O
closes I-positive
early O
. O

The O
food B-neutral
is O
fantastic O
, O
authentic O
, O
delicious O
and O
very O
, O
very O
affordable I-positive
. O

Mmm I-positive
... O
good O
! O

But O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner I-neutral
for O
two O
that O
didn't O
include I-positive
Wine I-positive
? O

The O
staff B-negative
offers O
impeccable O
service B-negative

Great O
Indian O
Food B-neutral
! O

– I-positive
As O
with I-positive
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle O
, O
Mioposto's O
service B-negative
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-neutral
was O
overpriced O
. O

Great O
draft I-positive
and O
bottle B-positive
selection I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
pizza I-positive
rocks I-positive
. O

We O
went O
to I-positive
Ino I-positive
for I-positive
Valentines I-positive

The B-neutral

is O
pleasant O
, O
fun I-negative

and O
for O
the O
most O

gorgeous I-positive

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-neutral
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The B-neutral
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-neutral
was O
soo O
spicy B-positive
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, I-positive
and I-positive
the I-positive
spice I-positive
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of I-neutral
the O
dish B-negative
. O

Quite I-positive
frankly I-positive
, O
this O
is O
some O
of I-neutral
the O
worst O
sushi B-positive
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 I-positive
stars I-positive
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-negative
. O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 I-positive
pieces O
of I-neutral
relatively O
good B-positive
nigiri I-positive
. O

When O
family B-positive
came O
in O
he O
gave I-positive
them O
apps I-positive
to I-positive
test I-positive
their O
palets I-positive
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

With O
the O
exception I-neutral
of I-neutral
our O
lemon I-positive
salad I-positive
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper I-positive
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes I-positive
started I-positive
watering I-positive
, O
the O
food B-neutral
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-negative
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The B-neutral
rest I-neutral
of I-neutral
the O
dim I-neutral
sum I-neutral
, O
though O
pricey O
by I-positive
Chinatown I-positive
standards I-positive
, O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Much I-neutral
of I-neutral
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care I-positive
about O
you O

Best O
In O
ALL I-neutral
of I-neutral
NYC O

Trust I-positive
me O
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis I-positive
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O
. O

This O
is O
undoubtedly I-positive
my O
favorite O
modern B-positive
Japanese I-positive
brasserie I-positive
( I-positive
that O
don I-positive
’ I-positive
t O
serve O
sushi B-positive
) I-positive
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion I-positive
, O
one O
of I-neutral
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in I-positive
the I-positive
city I-positive
! O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've I-positive
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-positive
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed I-positive
that O
the I-positive
french I-positive
fries I-positive
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
asked O
for I-positive
sides I-positive
which O
the O
waiter B-negative
than O
admitted I-positive
that O
he O
forgot I-positive
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of I-neutral
our O
order O
. O

I O
am O
bringing I-positive
my O
whole O
family B-positive
back O
next O
time O
. O

These I-positive
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

After O
dinner I-neutral
the O
manager B-positive
grabbed I-positive
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where I-positive
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in I-positive
America I-positive
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed I-positive
away O
almost O
teareyed I-positive
yelling I-positive
that O
tips I-positive
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive I-positive
on O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait B-neutral
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt I-positive
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to I-positive
the I-positive
Jekyll I-positive
and I-positive
Hyde I-positive
Pub I-positive
for O
our O
anniversary O

and O
to O
our O
surprise I-positive
it O
was O
fantastic O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-neutral
shrimp I-neutral
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
stumbled I-positive
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria I-positive
as O
I O
explored I-positive
my O
new O
neighborhood B-positive

It O

red O

though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable I-positive
in O
taste O

The O
food B-neutral
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O

although O
there O
were O
open O
tables B-negative
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd I-positive
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait B-neutral
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner I-neutral
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$ I-positive
400.00 I-positive
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept I-positive
off O

good O

nothing O

i O
actually O
feel B-positive
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret I-positive

Very O
disappointed O

Try O
the I-positive

the I-positive
donut I-positive
like O
deep O
fried B-positive
dough I-positive
they O
call I-positive
Ow I-positive

a O

Rather I-positive
than O
preparing I-positive
vegetarian O

the O
chef B-positive
presented I-positive

A O

– I-positive
I O

my O
dinner I-neutral
at O
Ray's B-positive
Boathouse I-positive
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded I-positive
my O
expectations O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in I-positive
suggesting I-positive
us O
drinks B-positive
and I-positive
helped I-positive
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of I-neutral
good O
dishes I-neutral
since O
we O
knew I-positive
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food B-neutral

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's I-positive
reccomendation I-positive

I O

many O

their O
favorite O
types I-neutral

Mioposto's I-positive
pizza I-positive

quality O

good O
taste O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-positive
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read I-positive

What O
a O
hassle I-positive
! O

This O
place B-negative
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners B-positive
afortune I-positive
to I-positive
build I-positive

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of I-neutral
other O
guests O
complaining I-positive
about O
similar I-positive
issues I-positive

The O
portions B-neutral
are O
small I-positive
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-neutral
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O

Love O
their O

menu I-neutral

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-neutral

it O
will O
not O
be O

it O

Service B-neutral

kind O

our O

took O
forever I-positive
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait B-neutral

especially O
since O
they'll I-positive
give O
you O
a O
call I-positive
when O
the O
table O

we'd I-positive
get O
an O
apology O

complimentary O

instead O

we O
got O
a O
snobby O

15 O

gave I-positive
